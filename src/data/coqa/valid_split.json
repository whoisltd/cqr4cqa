Birds in South America survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world via multiple land bridges while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period.

Shen'works are mostly about his hometown, Xiangxi, and most of Mo's stories are set in his hometown, Gaomi, in Shandong Province. \n\nMo said he also learned from Shen how to deal with characters in a fiction. Unlike most Chinese writers, Shen has a humanistic touch towards all of his characters. Said Mo, \"In his works, there are no particularly bad person or good person. Even gangsters and thieves have their humane side,\" he said. \n\n\"I try to use the same approach in my writing. It shows the ability of a novelist when he treats all the characters as humans,\" he said. \n\nMo said he also learned Lu Xun's depth and Lao She's humor. \"They are all my teachers, and I am the student,\" he said. \"I feel ashamed from my heart that teachers did not get the prize, but the student got it.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who received 2 nominations for the Nobel Prize?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who praised Shen?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Why did Mo feel close to Shen?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who else did Mo commend?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "And?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Did Mo finish school?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "How much school did he complete?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What about Shen?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did they do after quitting school?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What did Mo call this experience?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Are the themes of their writing similar?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What is the basis of their writings?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is Mo's hometown?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "And Shen's?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "What did Mo say he learned from Shen?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is unusual for Shen in his writings?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Does Mo try to replicate this in his writing?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What quality did Mo learn from Lu?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "And Lao?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 127, "span_end": 184, "span_text": "Shen Congwen, who was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize", "input_text": "Shen Congwen", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 42, "span_end": 186, "span_text": "Mo Yan showed respect for Chinese authors that he learned writing from, particularly Shen Congwen, who was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol \u20a5), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol \u00a2), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \"dime\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10\u00a2, while \"eagle\" and \"mill\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., $3.599, sometimes written as $3.599\u204410. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \"paper money\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 (known as the \"double eagle\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \"fractional currency\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \"shinplasters\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating $100, $50 and $25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \"Union\", \"Half Union\", and \"Quarter Union\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What's the smallest division of a dollar?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What's this called?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is this measurement used for?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Were gold coins used?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Up to what value?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What was measurement called?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did they fall out of use?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are coins worth more than a dollar produced today?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many $100 coins were produced?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How about $50 coins?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What would they have been called?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Was paper money less than a dollar ever used?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What negative term was used to describe them?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 400, "span_text": "Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the U.S. dollar is based upon a decimal system of values.

I dare say Harry will go along with you while Jake and I put up these logs.\" \n\nHarry lost no time in throwing down his handspike, and they set out together down a narrow trail through the woods, which led them out by and by upon a head above the cove in which the sloop lay moored.

The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the change of weather. Nance had been brooding on the scene at the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind, had taken the colour out of her cheeks. Mr. Archer, too, was somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and even upon his usually impassive countenance there were betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own hopes and fears. But Jonathan was the most altered: he was strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr. Archer with an eager and furtive eye. It seemed as if the idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more solid shape, and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed his imagination. \n\nAt this rate, conversation languished into a silence which was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins; and they were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced a visitor. It was the ostler from the \"Green Dragon\" bringing a letter for Mr. Archer. Nance saw her hero's face contract and then relax again at sight of it; and she thought that she knew why, for the sprawling, gross black characters of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him. He opened it and began to read; while the ostler sat down to table with a pot of ale, and proceeded to make himself agreeable after his fashion.

It consists of photons in the highest observed range of photon energy. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium. In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation \"gamma rays\". Rutherford had previously discovered two other types of radioactive decay, which he named alpha and beta rays. \n\nGamma rays are able to ionize atoms (ionizing radiation), and are thus biologically hazardous. The decay of an atomic nucleus from a high energy state to a lower energy state, a process called \"gamma decay\", produces gamma radiation. \n\nNatural sources of gamma rays on Earth are observed in the gamma decay of radionuclides and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. There are rare terrestrial natural sources, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, that produce gamma rays not of a nuclear origin. Additionally, gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation. However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft. Gamma rays are produced by nuclear fusion in stars including the Sun (such as the CNO cycle), but are absorbed or inelastically scattered by the stellar material, reducing their energy, before escaping and are not observable from Earth as gamma rays.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is our main topic?", "turn_id": 1, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "A.k.a?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What can they do to atoms?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "A.k.a.?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Are they safe?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Name on place where can natural spots of gamma decay be found?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Name another.", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What is those rays' origin?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What are Gamma rays?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where is there a radioactive decay?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "When did they get their name?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who named them?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What else did he discover?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 40, "span_text": "Gamma rays (also called gamma radiation)", "input_text": "Gamma rays", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 12, "span_end": 39, "span_text": "also called gamma radiation", "input_text": "gamma radiation", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 582, "span_end": 617, "span_text": "Gamma rays are able to ionize atoms", "input_text": "ionize them", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 605, "span_end": 638, "span_text": "ionize atoms (ionizing radiation)", "input_text": "ionizing radiation", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 640, "span_end": 675, "span_text": "and are thus biologically hazardous", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 986, "span_end": 1139, "span_text": " There are rare terrestrial natural sources, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, that produce gamma rays not of a nuclear origin", "input_text": "lightning strikes", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1038, "span_end": 1090, "span_text": " lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes", "input_text": "terrestrial gamma-ray flashes", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1091, "span_end": 1139, "span_text": " that produce gamma rays not of a nuclear origin", "input_text": "natural, not nuclear", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 106, "span_end": 147, "span_text": "are penetrating electromagnetic radiation", "input_text": "penetrating electromagnetic radiation", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 166, "span_end": 209, "span_text": "from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei", "input_text": "atomic nuclei", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 407, "span_end": 469, "span_text": "In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation \"gamma rays\".

John the Baptist is also mentioned by the Jewish historian Josephus. Some scholars maintain that John was influenced by the semi-ascetic Essenes, who expected an apocalypse and practiced rituals corresponding strongly with baptism, although no direct evidence substantiates this. \n\nAccording to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself.

The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is less than 31 of the largest U.S. cities including neighboring Denver. Cheyenne is the capital and the most populous city, with population estimated at 63,335 in 2015. \n\nThe western two-thirds of the state is covered mostly by the mountain ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains, while the eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie called the High Plains. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government, leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government. Federal lands include two national parksGrand Teton and Yellowstonetwo national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges. \n\nOriginal inhabitants of the region include the Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone.

Although Canberra is the capital and seat of government, many federal government ministries have secondary seats in state capital cities, as do the Governor-General and the Prime Minister. \n\nThe site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation's capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities, being an entirely planned city outside of any state, similar to Washington, D.C. in the United States, or Bras\u00edlia in Brazil. Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs such as circles, hexagons and triangles, and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks in the Australian Capital Territory. \n\nThe city's design was influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. The growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, which exacerbated a series of planning disputes and the ineffectiveness of a procession of bodies that were created in turn to oversee the development of the city. The national capital emerged as a thriving city after World War II, as Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies championed its development and the National Capital Development Commission was formed with executive powers.

Fukuda is now one of only four living people who have earned the tenth-degree black belt. Throughout history, only 16 people have ever achieved this honor. Fukuda began practicing Judo in 1935 and is the only surviving student of its founder, Kano Jiguro. At her teacher's requirement, she learned English to help spread Judo internationally. During a time when getting married, building a family and becoming a housewife were the norms ,Fukuda broke from tradition, continuing Judo instead of getting married. \"All I did was Judo ... This was my marriage,\" Fukuda replied tearfully to the San Francisco Chronicle. \"This is when my destiny was set. I just imagined how long the road would be.\" She described the Jiguro's school as \"old-fashioned and sexist about belts and ranks\". In fact, an edict that prevented women from achieving any higher than a fifth-degree black belt kept Fukuda at that level for 30 years. She finally got the sixth degree in 1972 when a women's division was created. Fukuda thinks Judo and her life to be \"gentle, kind and beautiful, yet firm and strong, both mentally and physically\". Fukuda says this kind of beauty is not external . She explained. \"I believe this inner beauty is true beauty...

She maintained with Lord Cadurcis a constant correspondence; he wrote to her every day, and although they were separated, there was not an incident of his life, and scarcely a thought, of which she was not cognisant. It was with great difficulty that George could induce himself to remain in London; but Masham, who soon obtained over him all the influence which Venetia desired, ever opposed his return to the abbey. The good Bishop was not unaware of the feelings with which Lord Cadurcis looked back to the hall of Cherbury, and himself of a glad and sanguine temperament, he indulged in a belief in the consummation of all that happiness for which his young friend, rather sceptically, sighed. But Masham was aware that time could alone soften the bitterness of Venetia's sorrow, and prepare her for that change of life which he felt confident would alone ensure the happiness both of herself and her mother. He therefore detained Lord Cadurcis in London the whole of the sessions that, on his return to Cherbury, his society might be esteemed a novel and agreeable incident in the existence of its inhabitants, and not be associated merely with their calamities.

later she bore up for Vancouver before a westerly breeze.

The big topsail swayed across it, blotting out the stars, and there was a rhythmic splashing beneath the bows. \n\nAnthea Merril stood at the tiller outlined against the heave of sea, for the night was warm and she was dressed in white. Nellie Austerly sat on a locker in the cockpit, and her father on the saloon skylights with a cigar in his hand. Valentine lay on the deck not far away, and Jimmy a little further forward. \n\n\"I suppose we will be in soon after daylight, and I'm sorry,\" said Nellie Austerly. \"It has been an almost perfect cruise in spite of the bad weather. Don't you wish we were going back again, instead of home, Anthea?\" \n\nJimmy roused himself to attention, for he would very much have liked to hear Miss Merril's real thoughts on the matter; but she laughed. \n\n\"I don't think it would be very much use if I did,\" she said. \"One can't go sailing always--and if you feel that that is a pity, you can think of the rain and the wind.\" \n\n\"Ah!\" said Nellie Austerly, \"one has to bear so much of them everywhere.

Are the remains buried in a French castle really those of the master? Was the \"Mona Lisa\" a self-portrait in disguise ? \n\nA group of Italian scientists believe the key to solving those puzzles lies with the remains, and they say they are seeking permission to dig up the body to conduct carbon and DNA testing. \n\nIf the skull is undamaged, the scientists can go to the heart of a question that has fascinated scholars and the public for centuries: the identity of the \"Mona Lisa.\" Recreating a virtual and then physical reconstruction of Leonardo's face, they can compare it with the smiling face in the painting. \n\n\"We don't know what we'll find if the tomb is opened. We could even just find grains and dust,\" says Giorgio Gruppioni, an anthropologist who is participating in the project. \"But if the remains are well kept, they are a biological record of events in a person's life, and sometimes in their death.\" Silvano Vinceti, the leader of the group, said that _ in charge of the said burial site at Amboise Castle early next week. \n\nLeonardo moved to France at the invitation of King Francis I, who named him \"first painter to the king.\" He spent the last three years of his life there, and died in 1519 at age 67. The artist's original burial place, the palace church of Saint Florentine, was destroyed during the French Revolution and remains that are believed to be his were eventually reburied in the Saint-Hubert Chapel near the castle. \n\n\"The Amboise tomb is a symbolic tomb; it's a big question mark,\" said Alessandro Vezzosi, the director of a museum dedicated to Leonardo in his hometown of Vinci. Vezzosi said that investigating the tomb could help identify the artist's bones with certainty and solve other questions, such as the cause of his death. He said he asked to open the tomb in 2004 to study the remains, but the Amboise Castle turned him down. \n\nThe group of 100 experts involved in the project, called the National Committee for Historical and Artistic Heritage, was created in 2003 with the aim of \"solving the great mysteries of the past,\" said Vinceti, who has written books on art and literature. \n\nArguably the world's most famous painting, the \"Mona Lisa\" hangs in the Louvre in Paris, where it drew some 8.5 million visitors last year. Mystery has surrounded the identity of the painting's subject for centuries, with opinions ranging from the wife of a Florentine merchant to Leonardo's own mother. \n\nThat Leonardo intended the \"Mona Lisa\" as a self-portrait in disguise is a possibility that has interested and divided scholars. Theories have existed: Some think that Leonardo's taste for tricks and riddles might have led him to hide his own identity behind that puzzling smile; others have guessed that the painting hid an androgynous lover. \n\nIf granted access to the grave site, the Italian experts plan to use a tiny camera and radar to confirm the presence of bones. The scientists would then exhume the remains and attempt to date the bones with carbon testing. \n\nAt the heart of the proposed study is the effort to discover whether the remains are actually Leonardo's, including with DNA testing. \n\nVezzosi questions the DNA comparison, saying he is unaware of any direct descendants of Leonardo or of tombs that could be attributed with certainty to the artist's close relatives. \n\nGruppioni said that DNA from the bones could also eventually be compared to DNA found elsewhere. For example, Leonardo is thought to have rubbed colors on the canvas with his thumb, possibly using saliva , meaning DNA might be found on his paintings. \n\nEven in the absence of DNA testing, other tests could provide useful information, including whether the bones belonged to a man or a woman, and whether the person died young or old. \n\nEven within the committee, experts are divided over the identity of the \"Mona Lisa.\" \n\nVinceti believes that a tradition of considering the self-portrait to be not just a faithful imitation of one's features but a representation of one's spiritual identity may have resonated with Leonardo. \n\nVezzosi, the museum director, dismissed as \"baseless and senseless\" the idea that the \"Mona Lisa\" could be a self-portrait of Leonardo. He said most researchers believe the woman may have been either a wife of the artist's sponsor, the Florentine nobleman Giuliano de Medici, or Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a rich silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. The traditional view is that the name \"Mona Lisa\" comes from the silk merchant's wife, as well as its Italian name: \"La Gioconda.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Whose body do scientists want to dig up?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What testing do they want to do?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "At what age did he die?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "In what year?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What happened to his original grave site?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "During which historical event?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was this original site?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Where is he thought to be reburied?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Are they sure?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is the world's most famous painting?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many people saw it last year?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is anyone certain who is depicted in the painting?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is one theory?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Does Vezzosi think that the Mona Lisa is a self-portrait?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "When did he first ask to study the remains?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Was he allowed?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What project was created in 2003?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "With how many experts involved?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What will carbon testing help scientists discover?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "What tools do experts plan to use?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 6, "span_end": 388, "span_text": "The legend of Leonardo da Vinci is covered in mystery: How did he die?

It's simple, it's elegant, you can slip it in your pocket, but it's got the great doodad when you need it,\" she told Fast Company in 2005. \"A lot of our competitors are like a Swiss Army knife open -- and that can be intimidating and occasionally harmful.\" \n\n2.

For both degrees, Mayer focused on artificial intelligence, which has become a core area of focus for Google, a company that has introduced autonomous cars and whose computers are trying to use equations to understand human speech.

The kingdom was founded and initially ruled by the royal Argead dynasty, which was followed by the Antipatrid and Antigonid dynasties. Home to the ancient Macedonians, the earliest kingdom was centered on the northeastern part of the Greek peninsula, and bordered by Epirus to the west, Paeonia to the north, Thrace to the east and Thessaly to the south. \n\nBefore the 4th century BC, Macedonia was a small kingdom outside of the area dominated by the great city-states of Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, and briefly subordinate to Achaemenid Persia. During the reign of the Argead king PhilipII (359\u2013336 BC), Macedonia subdued mainland Greece and Thrace through conquest and diplomacy. With a reformed army containing phalanxes wielding the \"sarissa\" pike, PhilipII defeated the old powers of Athens and Thebes in the Battle of Chaeronea in 338BC; Sparta was occupied a century later by Antigonus III Doson. PhilipII's son Alexander the Great, leading a federation of Greek states, accomplished his father's objective of commanding the whole of Greece when he destroyed Thebes after the city revolted. During Alexander's subsequent campaign of conquest, he overthrew the Achaemenid Empire and conquered territory that stretched as far as the Indus River.

All those years later, he still had the car's title that listed its vehicle identification number (VIN), which matched the VIN on eBay. \n\nBut there was one last catch. The car was not registered in the National Crime Information Center, an electronic clearinghouse of crime data. \n\nSo over the next few weeks, Russell and Sheriff's Detective Carlos Ortega were in touch with the police in Philadelphia. As it turned out, the car's VIN was incorrectly recorded at the time of the theft. \n\nThe error was corrected, and Ortgea was able to go to the dealership and confirm the car was, in fact, the one that was stolen. \n\nHe took possession of the vehicle, which in its current condition is estimated to be worth around $23,000, according to the sheriff's department.

He used the black swan fallacy to discuss falsification. If the outcome of an experiment contradicts the theory, one should refrain from ad hoc manoeuvres that evade the contradiction merely by making it less falsifiable. Popper is also known for his opposition to the classical justificationist account of knowledge, which he replaced with critical rationalism, \"the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy.\" \n\nKarl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902, to upper middle-class parents. All of Karl Popper's grandparents were Jewish, but the Popper family converted to Lutheranism before Karl was born, and so he received Lutheran baptism. They understood this as part of their cultural assimilation, not as an expression of devout belief. Karl's father Simon Siegmund Carl Popper was a lawyer from Bohemia and a doctor of law at the Vienna University, and mother Jenny Schiff was of Silesian and Hungarian descent. After establishing themselves in Vienna, the Poppers made a rapid social climb in Viennese society: Simon Siegmund Carl became a partner in the law firm of Vienna's liberal Burgomaster Herr Gr\u00fcbl and, after Gr\u00fcbl's death in 1898, Simon took over the business. (Malachi Hacohen records that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Raimund, after which Karl received his middle name. Popper himself, in his autobiography, erroneously recalls that Herr Gr\u00fcbl's first name was Carl.) His father was a bibliophile who had 12,000\u201314,000 volumes in his personal library.

In addition to rock music, there were channels for people who had a lot of interest in alternative kinds of music, such as country music, light music, and R&B(rhythm and blues), and all of these channels needed VJs. By the 1990s, international music video channels like Channel V in Asia and VIVA in Europe had started. \n\nThe VJs for the new international stations had to be chosen carefully. Although some VJs did shows that focused on small audiences and showed mostly local content, other VJs presented shows for international viewers. These VJs, and the material they presented, needed to be popular in several different cultures. \n\nOne successful international VJ in Asia is Asha Gill. She is from prefix = st1 /Malaysia, but her parents and grandparents are fromIndia,FranceandEngland. She speaks three languages and has fans across Asia, fromJapanto theUnited Arab Emirates. \n\nAnother VJ who has made a big hit in Asia is Lili. She is actually a computer- \n\nAnimated VJ on MTV Asia. An actress wearing special computer equipment makes Lili move like a puppet . The actress also talks for Lili, and her shows can be seen in five languages. \n\nWhen asked what makes a good video jockey, many successful VJs have given similar answers. To be a good VJ you need to know a lot about music, you need to be funny, and you can't be shy.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did MTV start airing?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What grew as a result of that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "And what is the occupation called for someone on a station like that?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does that stand for?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Is there a similar occupation to that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How is that one different from the other?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "When did stations begin to expand internationally?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are all VJ's human?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is an example of one that isn't?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where is she famous in?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "And for what program?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "How many languages does the program have?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is required to be good at the job?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What is an example of a genre that was new territory for VJ's?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "And other examples?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What was the program in Europe called?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Was there one in Spain?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What was needed for an international VJ?", "turn_id": 18}], "answers": [{"span_start": 200, "span_end": 244, "span_text": " in the early 1980s when MTV went on the air", "input_text": "1980s", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 246, "span_end": 374, "span_text": "As MTV became popular, and the audience for music videos expanded, a variety of other music video channels started broadcasting.", "input_text": "The audience for music videos.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 89, "span_end": 165, "span_text": ".

They spent two days beginning the task of formulating ideas about how to design such structures and to search for clues on how to do so in buildings that were damaged, but still are standing. \n\n\"Our objective in visiting ground zero was to go and look at the buildings surrounding the World Trade Center, those buildings that are still standing, but that sustained damage,\" said M. Bruneau, Ph.D. \"Our immediate hope is that we can develop a better understanding as to why those buildings remain standing, while our long-term goal is to see whether earthquake engineering technologies can be married to existing technologies to achieve enhanced performance of buildings in the event of terrorist attacks,\" he added. \n\nPhotographs taken by the investigators demonstrate the monumental damage to the World Trade Center towers and buildings nearby. One building a block away from the towers remains standing, but was badly damaged. \"This building is many meters away from the World Trade Center and yet we see a column there that used to be part of that building,\" explained A. Whittaker, Ph.D. \"The column became a missile that shot across the road, through the window and through the floor.\" \n\nThe visit to the area also brought some surprises, according to the engineers. For example, the floor framing system in one of the buildings was quite strong , allowing floors that were pierced by tons of falling debris to survive. \"Good framing systems may provide a simple, but reliable strategy for blast resistance,\" he added. Other strategies may include providing alternate paths for gravity loads in the event that a load-bearing column fails. \"We also need a better understanding of the mechanism of collapse,\" said A. Whittaker. \"We need to find out what causes a building to collapse and how you can predict it.\" \n\nA. Reinhorn, Ph.D. noted that \"earthquake shaking has led to the collapse of buildings in the past. Solutions developed for earthquake-resistant design may apply to blast engineering and terrorist-resistant design. Part of our mission now is to transfer these solutions and to develop new ones where none exist at present.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are engineers trying to solve?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What question is that?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who funded the project?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Where did they travel to?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where is ground zero?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Does M.

According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint by the church.(The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas.) His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas. Over the years, this custom became part of our Christmas traditions. \n\nRecently, a psychologist has claimed that Father Christmas is \"the perfect fantasy\" for children. According to Professor Anthony Clare, children love the character of Father Christmas because he is like an ideal father: he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them, is never angry, and children do not even need to thank him for the presents. Other writers, however, point out that Father Christmas can be a frightening character to some children. Jane Bidder says that some children are terrified of this fat, bearded old man. It can certainly confuse many children. As parents, we warn our children to be careful of strangers and never to let them into the house, and yet we tell children that a strange man will come into their bedroom at night! Some children can become very worried about this idea and fear that he is a kind of burglar. \n\nMost children, however, understand from their parents and from the media that Father Christmas is basically a _ character, and look forward to his annual visit with joy and excitement.", "questions": [{"input_text": "How did the legend of Santa Claus start?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What was his name?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "How does he get into people's houses?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "When did Nicholas live?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Why did he want to help the poor girls?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What is the theory of why children like Santa Claus so much?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What makes him so ideal?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Do all children feel that way about him?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Why not?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Why would they be frightened?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What did Nicholas drop down the chimneys?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Did he tell anyone that he was doing this?", "turn_id": 12}], "answers": [{"span_start": 540, "span_end": 569, "span_text": "a Christian bishop in Turkey ", "input_text": "a Christian bishop in Turkey", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 463, "span_end": 471, "span_text": "Nicholas", "input_text": "Nicholas", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 797, "span_end": 813, "span_text": "down the chimney", "input_text": "down the chimney", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 578, "span_end": 590, "span_text": "285--350 A.D", "input_text": "285--350 A.D.", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 708, "span_end": 753, "span_text": "To provide them with money for their weddings", "input_text": "to provide them with money so they could get married", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 1318, "span_end": 1344, "span_text": "he is like an ideal father", "input_text": "he is like an ideal father", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1346, "span_end": 1417, "span_text": "he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them", "input_text": "he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them and is never angry", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1586, "span_end": 1599, "span_text": "some children", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1552, "span_end": 1599, "span_text": "can be a frightening character to some children", "input_text": "he can be frightening to some children", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1960, "span_end": 1993, "span_text": "fear that he is a kind of burglar", "input_text": "they may think he is a burglar", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 786, "span_end": 797, "span_text": "gold coins ", "input_text": "gold coins", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 764, "span_end": 772, "span_text": "secretly", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 12}], "name": "high8556.txt"}, {"source": "gutenberg", "id": "3zsano2jcf7o3z14a4wo23y5mqzfs5", "filename": "data/gutenberg/txt/Thomas Hardy___Far from the Madding Crowd.txt/CHAPTER X_8acada4a5049d44d1e9dc0e8bc9e7cac14dfcfabd2f9fb197dc8116", "story": "CHAPTER X \n\nMISTRESS AND MEN \n\nHalf-an-hour later Bathsheba, in finished dress, and followed by Liddy, entered the upper end of the old hall to find that her men had all deposited themselves on a long form and a settle at the lower extremity.

He was 89. \n\nWatson, a Grammy winning musician who was blinded after birth, had been struggling to recover from May 24 colon surgery and then a followup procedure two days later. The Winston-Salem Journal had reported that Watson's family was called to his bedside Sunday at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center after he took a turn for the worse. \n\nThe website of Folklore Productions, which is run by the singer's representative, Mitch Greenhill, had been providing updates on his difficult recovery. \n\nWatson, who jumped onto the music scene in the early 1960s, is considered influential among folk musicians for his brand of bluegrass, blues, country and gospel music.

Her pony had jibbed on the way downhill, and the train was just on the point of moving off as she hurried upon the platform. Old Matthews, the stout and chubby-cheeked station-master, seized her most unceremoniously by the left arm, and bundled her into a carriage. He had known her from a child, so he could venture upon such liberties. \n\n\"Second class, miss? Yes, miss. Here y'are. Look sharp, please. Any more goin' on? All right, Tom! Go ahead there!\" And lifting his left hand, he whistled a shrill signal to the guard to start her. \n\nAs for Elma, somewhat hot in the face with the wild rush for her ticket, and grasping her uncounted change, pence and all, in her little gloved hand, she found herself thrust, hap-hazard, at the very last moment, into the last compartment of the last carriage --alone--with an artist. \n\nNow, you and I, to be sure, most proverbially courteous and intelligent reader, might never have guessed at first sight, from the young man's outer aspect, the nature of his occupation. The gross and clumsy male intellect, which works in accordance with the stupid laws of inductive logic, has a queer habit of requiring something or other, in the way of definite evidence, before it commits itself offhand to the distinct conclusion. But Elma Clifford was a woman; and therefore she knew a more excellent way. HER habit was, rather to look things once fairly and squarely in the face, and then, with the unerring intuition of her sex, to make up her mind about them firmly, at once and for ever. That's one of the many glorious advantages of being born a woman. You don't need to learn in order to know. You know instinctively.

Underprotective husband? \n\nNo one knows what was said amongst Solange Knowles, Jay Z and Beyonce in that elevator in the Standard Hotel in Manhattan or even what led up to the video that appears to show Solange kicking and hitting her brother-in-law. \n\nBut here is what we do know: the Internet is on fire with theories. \n\nEarlier this week, an elevator surveillance video surfaced that showed Solange appearing to berate Jay Z before she becomes physical. Her sister, Beyonce, is present and witnesses the attack. \n\nThe incident has inspired a hashtag, #WhatJaySaidToSolange, countless memes and tons of speculation. \n\nQuoting an anonymous source, Us Weekly reported that Solange Knowles had an earlier run-in with designer Rachel Roy. (Roy is the ex-wife of Damon Dash, Jay Z's former friend and business partner.) \n\nThe New York Daily News, also using an unnamed source, took it one step further. In addition to the alleged argument with Roy, the paper threw in Jay Z's supposed desire to head solo to a party being given by Rihanna. This, according to the Daily News, did not sit well with Beyonce's younger sister. \n\nTalk show host Wendy Williams also offered her own observations, including what appears to be the removal of a tattoo on Beyonce's finger of the roman numeral \"IV.\" It was reportedly her wedding ring tattoo, meant to symbolize both her wedding date (April 4) as well as her and Jay Z's birthdays (September 4 and December 4, respectively). \n\nSo far, some of the principal characters seem to be letting Instagram speak for them. Beyonce has posted happy pictures of her and her sister, while Solange participated in \"Throwback Thursday\" with a picture of the two siblings as kids.

The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik M\u00fclhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871\u20131918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years. \n\nWith the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

From there, he took her down into the basement about 24 hours later, she said. \n\nIt was the beginning of more than a decade of torture, rape, starvation and beatings for Knight. The hope of seeing her son again, she said, inspired her fight to survive. \n\n\"I want my son to know me as a victor, not a victim,\" Knight told host Dr. Phil McGraw. \"And I wanted him to know that I survived, loving him. His love got me through.\" \n\nCastro lured Knight into his vehicle from a Family Dollar store in Cleveland in 2002, promising to give her a ride. She was the first of three women he would capture and imprison in his home for about a decade. They were freed in May after one of the women, Amanda Berry, called out to neighbors for help. \n\nIn August, Castro was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping.

His lawyers Monday formally asked a panel of three judges for permission to tour the ship's bridge and engine room as part of a defense strategy that he says will prove that was not the only person responsible for the disaster. \n\nThe liner, which crashed on the rocks off Giglio Island in January 2012, killing 32 people, was rotated back to vertical last Monday. The unprecedented maneuver, called parbuckling, exposed a twisted mass of metal, dotted with mattresses, passenger luggage and deck chairs on the ship's previously submerged starboard side. Now that the Concordia is upright, there can be further investigation of the captain's alleged mishandling of the ship. \n\nRead more: Concordia righted \n\nDefense lawyers for Schettino agreed with lawyers representing more than 200 civil parties against the captain, including Giglio Island and several passenger and environmental advocacy groups, in asking for a new examination of the ship now that it is upright. Such an examination could include divers going deep into the belly of the vessel to examine whether watertight doors sealed properly, and whether automatic generators functioned. He also wants to walk the judges through the command bridge in a re-creation of the night of the crash. Half of the command bridge was submerged for 20 months. \n\nThe trial began with preliminary hearings last March, but Monday was the first time the court heard any substantial evidence in the case. A panel of maritime experts addressed the role of the Indonesian helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin in the accident. Rusli Bin and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements.

The scene was the Grove by Donnithorne Chase: you know who the men were. \n\nThe old squire's funeral had taken place that morning, the will had been read, and now in the first breathing-space, Arthur Donnithorne had come out for a lonely walk, that he might look fixedly at the new future before him and confirm himself in a sad resolution. He thought he could do that best in the Grove. \n\nAdam too had come from Stontion on Monday evening, and to-day he had not left home, except to go to the family at the Hall Farm and tell them everything that Mr. Irwine had left untold. He had agreed with the Poysers that he would follow them to their new neighbourhood, wherever that might be, for he meant to give up the management of the woods, and, as soon as it was practicable, he would wind up his business with Jonathan Burge and settle with his mother and Seth in a home within reach of the friends to whom he felt bound by a mutual sorrow. \n\n\"Seth and me are sure to find work,\" he said. \"A man that's got our trade at his finger-ends is at home everywhere; and we must make a new start. My mother won't stand in the way, for she's told me, since I came home, she'd made up her mind to being buried in another parish, if I wished it, and if I'd be more comfortable elsewhere.

As the key transportation link at joint place of the Great Canal ( Beijing-Hangzhou) and Changjiang (Yangtze River), Yangzhou has been from the Sui Dynasty (600 AD.) an economically rich city, and then reached its top in the Tang Dynasty. At that time Yangzhou was a famous port and one of few biggest cities in East Asia. With the improvement of the local economy and easy transportation way, there happened in the history a special local culture, which has an important place in Chinese culture. Many famous men of letters, poets, artists, scholars , statesmen, scientists and national heroes in the history were born in, lived in or had connection with Yangzhou. Li Bai, one of the greatest Chinese poets visited and stayed in Yangzhou several times in his life and one of his famous poems about Yangzhou has been so popular that Chinese of all ages can sing it and has become a symbol of Yangzhou . Zheng Banqiao, a famous Chinese painting painter in the Qing Dynasty heading a group called \"Eight Eccentrics\", had strongly influenced Chinese paintings. Wang Zhong and Yuan Yuan and some other scholars formed school of Yangzhou Scholars and achieved great success in the study of classic Chinese and writing. Zhu Ziqing, one of most famous modern Chinese writers and scholars, had always been proud of himself as a native of Yangzhou and thanked the city for being nourished by its rich culture. Quite a few other names you may come across frequently in the study of Chinese culture and history have connection with Yangzhou .

I chose December 15 as the starting date, which marked three years since my mother died from heart disease. She was one of the most generous people that I have ever known. She always thought of others first and certainly serves as an inspiration to me. \n\nI had a rather busy day yesterday, ironic for someone who is unemployed right now. In the morning I went to the gym, and unsuccessfully got the phone call from the unemployment office for some job searching. Before I knew it, it was noon. I grabbed a quick lunch and rushed down to a meeting. On my way to Connecticut, I wondered if I would see someone that I would feel forced to give my first $10 to. I was running late and decided to do it afterwards. \n\nAfter the meeting I had about half an hour to find the first person of my Year of Giving! I decided to check out Dupont Circle. I had met a guy there named Jerry once and thought he would willingly accept my first $10. He wasn't there, but I did see a man sitting by himself who looked really lonely, so I approached him. Now I had to figure out what I was going to say. I think I said something like, \"Hi, can I sit down here?\" \"I would like to know if I could give you $10?\" He asked me to repeat what I had said. I did, then he looked at me funny, got up and left. \n\nI then started walking south where I spotted a man standing by the bus stop on Connecticut Ave. He appeared to be in his 60s. I don't know what drew me to him, but I thought I would make my second attempt. I was a bit nervous and asked him which bus came by that stop. Then I explained that I was starting a year-long project to give $10 to someone every day and that I wanted to give my $10 for today to him. The gentleman, I later found out that his name was Ed, responded without hesitation that he could not accept my offer and that there were many people more deserving the money than him.

They played it for the first time at Maure in the following week, with Andre-Louis--who was known by now as Scaramouche to all the company, and to the public alike--in the title-role. If he had acquitted himself well as Figaro-Scaramouche, he excelled himself in the new piece, the scenario of which would appear to be very much the better of the two. \n\nAfter Maure came Pipriac, where four performances were given, two of each of the scenarios that now formed the backbone of the Binet repertoire. In both Scaramouche, who was beginning to find himself, materially improved his performances. So smoothly now did the two pieces run that Scaramouche actually suggested to Binet that after Fougeray, which they were to visit in the following week, they should tempt fortune in a real theatre in the important town of Redon. The notion terrified Binet at first, but coming to think of it, and his ambition being fanned by Andre-Louis, he ended by allowing himself to succumb to the temptation. \n\nIt seemed to Andre-Louis in those days that he had found his real metier, and not only was he beginning to like it, but actually to look forward to a career as actor-author that might indeed lead him in the end to that Mecca of all comedians, the Comedie Francaise. And there were other possibilities.

The sounds ceased abruptly and Jake's voice reached them. \n\n\"Tramp it down good!\" he called. \"You've got to squeeze in this lot and another.\" \n\nFrank choked down the answer which rose to his lips. But the hay must be got in, and the boys fell with their forks upon the first of the crackling grass Jake flung up to them. There seemed to be more dust in it than usual, and before the jumper was half unloaded they were panting heavily. When at last the oxen hauled the sled away they stood doubled up knee-deep in the hay with their backs close against the roof.

Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms, known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \"consumption\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. \n\nOne-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries.

He approached Matej Peljhan, an amateur photographer and a psychologist at CIRIUS rehabilitation center near Ljubljana, Slovenia, where Luka is a patient. At first, Peljhan was perplexed. How could he photograph a boy who can not move or act in motion? \"Luka wanted to see himself playing and having fun, but it seemed impossible,\" he says. Then Peljhan had a brainstorm: Luka could lie down on a piece of cloth and, with the help of an assistant, Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard, and playing basketball. Then Peljhan would shoot these images from above. The photos took about a month to produce; all were shot early this year. Peljhan, who lost his right arm and left eye as a child, says his own disabilities motivated him to make the photographs. \"I understand people with limitations,\" he says. He named the series \"The Little Prince\" after the French story by Antoine de Saint-Exupery in which a boy teaches a man about trust, hope, and friendship. Luka loves the photos. Matej himself understands what it is like to live with limitations--he lost his right arm and left eye as a child.\"Luka wants to stay positive and his imagination helps him forget his physical limitation,\" says Peljhan. \"He's fragile, but he can see the world differently.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is Luka's impairment?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "How does he get around?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What did he want to do last year?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who would take the pictures?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where did he work?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where is that located?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Did Peljhan think this was a normal request?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What did Luka lie down on?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "And what did Peljhan do with him?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long did it take to make all the photos?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What was Peljhan's disability?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What did he call the photo series?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was Luka satisfied with the pictures?", "turn_id": 13}], "answers": [{"span_start": 198, "span_end": 216, "span_text": "muscular dystrophy", "input_text": "muscular dystrophy", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 245, "span_end": 259, "span_text": "his wheelchair", "input_text": "his wheelchair", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 315, "span_end": 364, "span_text": " to be photographed walking around and having fun", "input_text": "to be photographed walking around and having fun", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 380, "span_end": 393, "span_text": "Matej Peljhan", "input_text": "Matej Peljhan", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 441, "span_end": 469, "span_text": "CIRIUS rehabilitation center", "input_text": "CIRIUS rehabilitation center", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 475, "span_end": 494, "span_text": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "input_text": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 531, "span_end": 552, "span_text": "Peljhan was perplexed", "input_text": "no", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 761, "span_end": 777, "span_text": "a piece of cloth", "input_text": "a piece of cloth", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 814, "span_end": 912, "span_text": "Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard", "input_text": "Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1010, "span_end": 1017, "span_text": "a month", "input_text": "a month", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1061, "span_end": 1116, "span_text": "Peljhan, who lost his right arm and left eye as a child", "input_text": "he lost his right arm and left eye", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1253, "span_end": 1270, "span_text": "The Little Prince", "input_text": "The Little Prince", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1387, "span_end": 1408, "span_text": "Luka loves the photos", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 13}], "name": "high19297.txt"}, {"source": "mctest", "id": "3sbehtycwn359cf3aiuynmzyiuayix", "filename": "mc160.train.69", "story": "Mary loved walking through the woods with her dog, Max.

have known that trouble was coming,not only for himself,but for every big dog,strong of muscle and with long,warm hair in California.Men had found gold in the Yukon,and these men wanted big,strong dogs to work in the cold and snow of the north. \n\nBuck lived at a big house in the sunkissed Santa Clara valley.Judge Miller's place,it was called.There were large gardens and fields of fruit trees around the house,and a river nearby.In a big place like this,of course,there were many dogs.There were house dogs and farm dogs,but they were not important.Over this great land Buck ruled.Here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life.He was not so large--he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds.But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere housedog.Hunting and outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles.He went swimming with Judge Miller's sons,and walking with his daughters.He carried the grandchildren on his back,and he sat at Judge Miller's feet in front of the warm library fire in winter.During the four years,he had a fine pride in himself which came of good living and universal respect.He was king of Judge Miller's place. \n\nBut this was 1897,and Buck did not know that men and dogs were hurrying to northwest Canada to look for gold.And he did not know that Manuel,one of the gardener's helpers,was in bad need of money for his hobby of gambling and for his large family.One day,the Judge was at a meeting and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club.No one saw Manuel and Buck go off on what Buck imagined was merely an evening walk.Only one man saw them arrive at the railway station.This man talked to Manuel,and gave him some money.Then Manuel tied a piece of rope around Buck's neck. \n\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity .He had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit.But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands,Buck roared,and was surprised when the rope tightened around his neck,shutting off his breath.In extreme anger,he jumped at the man.The man caught him and suddenly Buck was thrown over on his back.Then the rope tightened cruelly while Buck struggled,his tongue out of his mouth.Never in all his life had he been so badly treated.Never in all his life had he been so angry.For a few moments he was unable to move,and it was easy for the two men to put him into the train. \n\nWhen Buck woke up,the train was still moving.The man was sitting and watching him,but Buck was too quick for him and he bit the man's hand hard.Then the rope was pulled again and Buck had to let go. \n\nThat evening,the man took Buck to the back room of a bar in San Francisco.The barman looked at the man's hand and trousers covered in blood. \n\n\"How much are they paying you for this?\"he asked. \n\n\"Only get fifty dollars.\" \n\n\"And the man who stole him--how much did he get?\"asked the barman. \n\n\"A hundred.He wouldn't take less.\" \n\n\"That makes a hundred and fifty.It's a good price for a dog like him.\" \n\nBuck spent that night in a cagelike box.He could not understand what it all meant.What did they want with him,these strange men?And where were Judge Miller and the boys? \n\nThe next day Buck was carried in the box to the railway station and put on a train to the north.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Where did Buck live?", "turn_id": 1},

RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome. \n\nSome RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is protein synthesis, a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on ribosomes. This process uses transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to deliver amino acids to the ribosome, where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) then links amino acids together to form proteins. \n\nLike DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form double helices. Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins. In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis (like enzymes). For instance, determination of the structure of the ribosome\u2014an enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond formation\u2014revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is the article about?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is it similar to?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What is it similar to?", "turn_id": 3, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"input_text": "What does it do?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What do they actively do?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How is it different from DNA?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What shape are they?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are they like enzymes?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What kind of acids are they?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 18, "span_end": 21, "span_text": "RNA", "input_text": "RNA", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 151, "span_end": 154, "span_text": "DNA", "input_text": "DNA", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": -1, "span_end": -1, "span_text": "unknown", "input_text": "unknown", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 88, "span_end": 141, "span_text": "coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes", "input_text": "codes, decodes, regulates, and expresses genes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 832, "span_end": 952, "span_text": "catalyzing biological reactions, controlling gene expression, or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals", "input_text": "catalyze biological reactions, control gene expression, sense and communicate responses to cellular signals", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 412, "span_end": 481, "span_text": " single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand", "input_text": "single-strand rather than double-strand", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1629, "span_end": 1707, "span_text": " collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins", "input_text": "collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1708, "span_end": 1776, "span_text": " In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis (like enzymes)", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1726, "span_end": 1761, "span_text": "RNAs can achieve chemical catalysis", "input_text": "they can achieve chemical catalysis", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 159, "span_end": 172, "span_text": "nucleic acids", "input_text": "nucleic acids", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "RNA.txt"}, {"source": "race", "id": "36zn444ytrytfyb14vl0lv1w5msios", "filename": "high1803.txt", "story": "Recipients of this year's Annenberg scholarships were announced on June 19.

Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines. Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts. In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts. \"Our brain has billions of body cells . These send signals through the spinal cord to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part.\" Tavella says. \"Our system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines.\" The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain. Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands.\" The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair.\" He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from. And the other is sure that they can use the technology for long.", "questions": [{"input_text": "Scientists have been searching since what year?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "To find what?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Which technology could help people with disabilities?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Jose Milan and Michele Tavella are from what school?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Located in?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "A small robotic what can be directed by a person's thoughts?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where did Tavella test it?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "He could even do what as he watched the vehicle?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Our brain has billions of what?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "That send signals through what?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "To give the ability to what?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What can prevent electrical signals?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Scientists designed a special what?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Which picks up what?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Then sends them to?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Which finds meanings of what?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "The wheelchair also has how many cameras?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Which do what?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "What two groups of technology  can BCI technology offer?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How many goals have been set?", "turn_id": 20}, {"input_text": "The first goal is?", "turn_id": 21}, {"input_text": "The second goal is?", "turn_id": 22}], "answers": [{"span_start": 5, "span_end": 15, "span_text": " the 1970s", "input_text": "the 1970s", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 60, "span_end": 92, "span_text": "connect the brain with computers", "input_text": "how to connect brain to computers", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 94, "span_end": 133, "span_text": "Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology", "input_text": "Braincomputer interface", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 263, "span_end": 314, "span_text": " Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland", "input_text": "Federal Polytehnic School", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 293, "span_end": 314, "span_text": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "input_text": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 336, "span_end": 347, "span_text": " wheelchair", "input_text": "wheelchair", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1657, "span_end": 1675, "span_text": "with real patients", "input_text": "with real patients", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 499, "span_end": 504, "span_text": " talk", "input_text": "talk", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 591, "span_end": 601, "span_text": "body cells", "input_text": "body cells", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 631, "span_end": 646, "span_text": "the spinal cord", "input_text": "the spinal cord", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 689, "span_end": 694, "span_text": " move", "input_text": "move", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 700, "span_end": 720, "span_text": "spinal cord injuries", "input_text": "spinal cord injuries", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 959, "span_end": 962, "span_text": "cap", "input_text": "cap", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1007, "span_end": 1028, "span_text": "ignals from the scalp", "input_text": "signals from the scalp", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1047, "span_end": 1057, "span_text": "a computer", "input_text": "a computer", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1089, "span_end": 1101, "span_text": " the signals", "input_text": "the signals", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 1170, "span_end": 1173, "span_text": "two", "input_text": "two", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 1218, "span_end": 1234, "span_text": "help the compute", "input_text": "help the computer", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1533, "span_end": 1571, "span_text": "communication, and controlling objects", "input_text": "communication, and controlling objects", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 1631, "span_end": 1634, "span_text": "two", "input_text": "two", "turn_id": 20}, {"span_start": 1649, "span_end": 1675, "span_text": "testing with real patients", "input_text": "testing with real patients", "turn_id": 21}, {"span_start": 1765, "span_end": 1811, "span_text": "sure that they can use the technology for long", "input_text": "ensure that they can use the technology for long periods of time", "turn_id": 22}], "name": "middle2943.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3cplwgv3mozimcimzmfatd2owkd9nu", "filename": "Packet_switchingPacket_switching_7074b4bc28396aab2154ae72ba61447dd9666f260d24989869e0744a", "story": "Starting in the late 1950s, American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation, funded by the US Department of Defense.

The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. The palace fell into disrepair during the English Civil War and was rebuilt as the Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors by Sir Christopher Wren and his assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor. These buildings became the Royal Naval College in 1873, and they remained an establishment for military education until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by University of Greenwich and Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. \n\nThe town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there, such as Vanbrugh Castle (1717) established on Maze Hill, next to the park. From the Georgian period estates of houses were constructed above the town centre. The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century, with the siting of the \"Cutty Sark\" and \"Gipsy Moth IV\" next to the river front, and the National Maritime Museum in the former buildings of the Royal Hospital School in 1934.

Established to train Congregationalist ministers in theology and sacred languages, by 1777 the school's curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences. In the 19th century the school incorporated graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first Ph.D. in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. \n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the University owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, including the Yale Bowl, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forest and nature preserves throughout New England. The university's assets include an endowment valued at $25.6 billion as of September 2015, the second largest of any educational institution.The Yale University Library, serving all constituent

not read the newspapers,or he would have known that trouble was coming,not only for himself,but for every big dog,strong of muscle and with long,warm hair in California.Men had found gold in the Yukon,and these men wanted big,strong dogs to work in the cold and snow of the north. \n\nBuck lived at a big house in the sunkissed Santa Clara valley.Judge Miller's place,it was called.There were large gardens and fields of fruit trees around the house,and a river nearby.In a big place like this,of course,there were many dogs.There were house dogs and farm dogs,but they were not important.Over this great land Buck ruled.Here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life.He was not so large--he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds.But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere housedog.Hunting and outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles.He went swimming with Judge Miller's sons,and walking with his daughters.He carried the grandchildren on his back,and he sat at Judge Miller's feet in front of the warm library fire in winter.During the four years,he had a fine pride in himself which came of good living and universal respect.He was king of Judge Miller's place. \n\nBut this was 1897,and Buck did not know that men and dogs were hurrying to northwest Canada to look for gold.And he did not know that Manuel,one of the gardener's helpers,was in bad need of money for his hobby of gambling and for his large family.One day,the Judge was at a meeting and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club.No one saw Manuel and Buck go off on what Buck imagined was merely an evening walk.Only one man saw them arrive at the railway station.This man talked to Manuel,and gave him some money.Then Manuel tied a piece of rope around Buck's neck. \n\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity .He had learned to trust in men he knew and to give them credit.But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger's hands,Buck roared,and was surprised when the rope tightened around his neck,shutting off his breath.In extreme anger,he jumped at the man.The man caught him and suddenly Buck was thrown over on his back.Then the rope tightened cruelly while Buck struggled,his tongue out of his mouth.Never in all his life had he been so badly treated.Never in all his life had he been so angry.For a few moments he was unable to move,and it was easy for the two men to put him into the train. \n\nWhen Buck woke up,the train was still moving.The man was sitting and watching him,but Buck was too quick for him and he bit the man's hand hard.Then the rope was pulled again and Buck had to let go. \n\nThat evening,the man took Buck to the back room of a bar in San Francisco.The barman looked at the man's hand and trousers covered in blood. \n\n\"How much are they paying you for this?\"he asked. \n\n\"Only get fifty dollars.\" \n\n\"And the man who stole him--how much did he get?\"asked the barman. \n\n\"A hundred.He wouldn't take less.\" \n\n\"That makes a hundred and fifty.It's a good price for a dog like him.\" \n\nBuck spent that night in a cagelike box.He could not understand what it all meant.What did they want with him,these strange men?And where were Judge Miller and the boys? \n\nThe next day Buck was carried in the box to the railway station and put on a train to the north.", "questions": [{"input_text":

But a quick family visit home before heading for Europe changed everything. He saw a very old man under a bridge eating his own human waste for food while visiting a friend in the south Indian city of Madurai in 502. Shocked by this, Krishnan gave up his job within the week and returned home for good, convinced of his new cause. \n\n\"That inspiration is a driving force still inside me as a flame--to serve all the mentally ill and the people who cannot take care of themselves,\" Krishnan said. He founded the organization Akshaya Trust in 503. In Hindu mythology , Goddess Annapoorani's \"Akshaya bowl\" fed the hungry endlessly, never using up its resources.

Jesuits also give retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes, sponsor direct social ministries, and promote ecumenical dialogue. \n\nIgnatius of Loyola, a Basque nobleman from the Pyrenees area of northern Spain, founded the society after discerning his spiritual vocation while recovering from a wound sustained in the Battle of Pamplona. He composed the \"Spiritual Exercises\" to help others follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. In 1534, Ignatius and six other young men, including Francis Xavier and Peter Faber, gathered and professed vows of poverty, chastity, and later obedience, including a special vow of obedience to the Pope in matters of mission direction and assignment. Ignatius's plan of the order's organization was approved by Pope Paul III in 1540 by a bull containing the \"Formula of the Institute\". \n\nIgnatius was a nobleman who had a military background, and the members of the society were supposed to accept orders anywhere in the world, where they might be required to live in extreme conditions. Accordingly, the opening lines of the founding document declared that the society was founded for \"whoever desires to serve as a soldier of God to strive especially for the defence and propagation of the faith and for the progress of souls in Christian life and doctrine.\" Jesuits are thus sometimes referred to colloquially as \"God's soldiers\", \"God's marines\", or \"the Company\", which evolved from references to Ignatius' history as a soldier and the society's commitment to accepting orders anywhere and to endure any conditions.

It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make.

A Chinese student had to call 110 for help this week after he got his arm stuck in a toilet trying to rescue his mobile phone. After dropping his phone in the toilet, he decided to wrap(,) his arm in newspaper in the hopes of keeping clean. But the newspapers became larger in size in the water, and then even his roommates couldn't help him pull his arm out. So policemen were called and they spent an hour unsticking the stuck student. Passage 2 Crazy Pet Lovers How much do you love your pets? Many people in China are famous for how much they love their pets. They dress them up in fashionable clothing and buy them high quality food. But would they spend 7,000 English pounds (68,000 yuan) on a wedding for their pets? And that's what a couple in Brazil spent on a fancy wedding for their pet Yorkshire terriers( a kind of dog). Passage 3 Oh, rats! When something goes wrong, you can often hear Westerners cry \"Oh, rats\". But when it comes to Southern China, \"Oh, rats!\" can mean it's what you want for dinner. According to a report in China Daily, some restaurants in Guangzhou serve rat meat. But, actually, most of those rats are field mice. What would Mickey Mouse say? Passage 4 Liar , liar Here's some news that most women already know. Men tell more lies than women. The London Daily Mail cites a new study that says men tell about three lies a day, while women tell only two lies a day. Men are also less likely to feel guilty about lying, according to this week's survey of 3,000 people by a research organization called One Poll. According to the Poll, lying to our mothers is very popular. But then, so is lying at work. And both men and women will lie when it comes to how much they've drunk.

He was returning under the arcades, towards the Rue St. Florentin, when Sidonia passed him in an opposite direction, on horseback, and at a rapid rate. Coningsby, who was not observed by him, could not resist a strange temptation to watch for a moment his progress. He saw him enter the court of the hotel where the Wallinger family were staying. Would he come forth immediately? No. Coningsby stood still and pale. Minute followed minute. Coningsby flattered himself that Sidonia was only speaking to the porter. Then he would fain believe Sidonia was writing a note. Then, crossing the street, he mounted by some steps the terrace of the Tuileries, nearly opposite the Hotel of the Minister of Finance, and watched the house. A quarter of an hour elapsed; Sidonia did not come forth. They were at home to him; only to him. Sick at heart, infinitely wretched, scarcely able to guide his steps, dreading even to meet an acquaintance, and almost feeling that his tongue would refuse the office of conversation, he contrived to reach his grandfather's hotel, and was about to bury himself in his chamber, when on the staircase he met Flora.

Suddenly he hdd a brilliant idea. He stopped the meeting and asked everyone present what would happen if Sony removed the recording function and 'speaker and sold headphones with a tape player instead. Almost everyone thought he was crazy. Still ,Ibuka kept thinking about his idea and worked at improving it The result, of course, turned out to be the wildly successful Sony Walkman. Good ideas often start with a seemingly silly question. Bill Bowerman was making breakfast one day. As he stood there making waffles for his son, he wondered what would happen if he poured rubber into his waffle iron. Later ,he tried it and the result looked something Like the bottom of most sports shoes we see today. Still, when he took this idea to several existing shoe companies, he was laughed at In fact, every single company turned him down. Though rather discouraged, Bowerman insisted and went on to form his own company, making NBKE athletic shoes. Sometime good ideas grow out of frustration .When Fred Smith was a student at Yale University, he had some paperwork that he needed to have delivered across the country the next day. Smith was amazed to find out that overnight delivery was impossible. He sat for a long while ,lost in thought Why couldn't there be a reliable overnight mail delivery service? He decided to design one. Smith did just that and turned his design into a class project His business professor gave him only a C for his efforts. However, Smith was not through. He improved the idea in that class project and finally turned them into one of the first and most successful overnight mail service in the world -- FedEx. We know that each of these ideas led to a very successful product or service that has changed the way many of us live. The best questions are usually open-ended and are often silly, Children aren't afraid to ask such questions ,but adults frequently are.

They took to each other immediately and became inseparable friends throughout their school lives. Elena's parents had moved from Greece to Australia, and her grandparents still lived on the small Greek island of Santorini, When she was 16, Elena visited her grandparents for the first time. On returning to Australia, she talked endlessly about her grandmother's next-door neighbor, Mara. When Christine expressed puzzlement at Elena's obsession with people next door, Elena admitted that Maria had a handsome son called Nicos. She showed Christine a photo of him, standing next to his prize possession, a motorbike. Elena and Nicos exchanged emails for a while, but suddenly Nicos stopped writing. While not heartbroken, Elena was nevertheless hurt. A year later, when Christine announced that she was going to visit Greece, Elena begged her to visit Santorini and say hello to Maria and Nicos. Christine agreed to do so. \n\nWhen she flew into Athens on an unseasonably cold day in September, she quickly realized that she hadn't brought enough warm clothes. Walking through the streets of the Greek capital, she happened to see a nice coat in a shop window and went in to ask about the price. The coat was too expensive, but as Christine was about to leave the shop, the woman asked her where she was from. When Christine answered Australia, the woman agreed to reduce the price because she knew a nice girl from Australia called Elena. Christine then noticed a photo of a young man standing next to a motorbike. Her eyes opened wide with astonishment. It was Nicos! Indeed the young man was Nicos, and the woman in the shop was Maria.

And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. To celebrate the iconic program's fortieth anniversary, InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women's at-work style. \n\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' \n\nMary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples, including double-breasted coats, knee-high boots, and that famous blue tam. But it was her 70s work-wear that most women sought: colorful scarves, two-piece suits, and bright, office-appropriate dresses. \n\nSee all 10 shows that influenced women's at-work wardrobes \n\n\"Dynasty\" \n\nOkay, so the Carrington women weren't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers. Nevertheless, the big-shouldered, wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis (Joan Collins) and her longtime rival Krystle (Linda Evans) were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line, \"The Dynasty Collection\" which was designed by the show's costumer, Nolan Miller. \n\n\"Ally McBeal\" \n\nIn 1998, shortly after the show's first season finale, Ally McBeal's disembodied head appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with the question, \"Is Feminism Dead?\" Despite the conclusions reached by that article (is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B. Anthony and Gloria Steinem?), women do owe something to the flighty young lawyer played by Calista Flockhart: She almost singlehandedly made the workplace safe for bare legs, freeing us from the tyranny of mandatory pantyhose.

Richard had never come within six of the top, but had been past at every examination by younger boys, till his father could bear it no longer; and now Norman was too young to be likely to have much chance of being of the number.

All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as \"Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie.\" There is no real way to categorize McLean's \"American Pie\" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. \n\nOn Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. \n\nMcLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. \"The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?\" McLean recalled. \"Nobody cared. Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.\" By cathartically writing \"American Pie,\" McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. \n\nHaving recorded his first album, \"Tapestry,\" in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the \"generation lost in space.\" When his cultural anthem \"American Pie\" was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A Changin\" as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade. It's important to think of \"American Pie\" as one would of Henry Longfellow's \"Evangeline\" or Johnny Mercer's \"Moon River\" -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.

Muddocks and Cramble could not send her forth equipped as she ought to be equipped for such a husband in so short a time. \"Perhaps they do it quicker in London,\" she said to Everett with a soft regret, remembering the metropolitan glories of her sister's wedding. And then Arthur Fletcher could be present during the Whitsuntide holidays; and the presence of Arthur Fletcher was essential. And it was not only his presence at the altar that was needed;--Parliament was not so exacting but that he might have given that;--but it was considered by the united families to be highly desirable that he should on this occasion remain some days in the country. Emily had promised to attend the wedding, and would of course be at Wharton for at least a week. As soon as Everett had succeeded in wresting a promise from his sister, the tidings were conveyed to Fletcher. It was a great step gained. When in London she was her own mistress; but surrounded as she would be down in Herefordshire by Fletchers and Whartons, she must be stubborn indeed if she should still refuse to be taken back into the flock, and be made once more happy by marrying the man whom she confessed that she loved with her whole heart. The letter to Arthur Fletcher containing the news was from his brother John, and was written in a very business-like fashion. \"We have put off Mary's marriage a few days, so that you and she should be down here together. If you mean to go on with it, now is your time.\" Arthur, in answer to this, merely said he would spend the Whitsuntide holidays at Longbarns.

Wolf had gone; he declared he could not put off another engagement, but Mrs. Austin wondered. The fellow was clever and knew when to stop. A man like that did not go farther than was necessary and risk losing ground he had won. All the same, Mrs. Austin was satisfied. She had paid her debt, and although she had hesitated about asking Wolf, she now felt her doing so was justified. He had interested her famous guests; the dinner party had gone well. \n\nSe\u00f1or Ramirez occupied a chair by a table that carried some fine glass _copitas_ from which one drinks the scented liquors used in Spain. His family was old and distinguished, and his post important. He was thin, dark-skinned and marked by an urbane dignity. As a rule, he looked languid, but sometimes his glance was keen. \n\nDon Arturo sat opposite. He was strongly built and getting fat. Although his hair and eyes were very black, he was essentially British. He had known poverty, but now controlled large commercial undertakings and steamship lines. Don Arturo was loved and hated. Some found him strangely generous, and some thought him hard and careless about the tools he used and broke.

As with other parts of China's southwest, Japanese occupation in the north during World War II forced another migration of majority Han people into the region.

He's got to watch out.

He has purchased a series of educational software to help him with his schoolwork. \n\n\"It was a great place to explore, and the information you gathered was great,\" Zachary said. \"Now it's dangerous.\" But Zachary Thomas still sees benefits from going online and says he can do it at the library or at school. \"It can be a good thing for kids,\" Zachary said. But he wasn't upset when his father pulled the plug . \n\nZachary's attitude to the Internet is in line with the study's findings, confirming that teens, who have never known a world without online access, generally have a more positive view of the Internet than their parents. \n\nMore parents are getting online themselves, making them know about their children's online activities, Lenhart said. \n\nBut that doesn't mean they understand everything. It also doesn't mean they needn't monitor the websites their children visit or set limits on the amount of time they spend online. \n\n\"I'm still trying to figure out the role of it,\" said John

Premier League encounter at Anfield. \n\nCity, who needed a victory to move above Chelsea into third place in the table, were blown away by a devastating first half performance from Liverpool, who have consolidated sixth position with this result. \n\nLiverpool began brightly and nearly took a seventh-minute lead when Luis Suarez's fine strike was tipped onto the post by City's England goalkeeper Joe Hart. \n\nBut the visiting defense was struggling to cope with Liverpool's wave of attacks and the hosts took a deserved lead six minutes later when Carroll's superbly struck left-footed strike, from just outside the area, swerved past Hart for his first goal since joining the club for a British record transfer fee in January. \n\nLiverpool doubled their lead in the 34th minute when City failed to clear a succession of crosses and blocked shots, the ball eventually falling to the feet of Dirk Kuyt who fired through the legs of defender Alexander Kolarov and past Hart. \n\nLiverpool made it 3-0 a minute later when Raul Meireles curled in an inviting cross from the left for Carroll to outjump Kolarov and help the ball into the far corner of the net. \n\nLiverpool had chances to increase their lead after the break but Hart did well to keep out efforts from Meireles and Kuyt, while Suarez fired wide from an acute angle and Carroll headed over the crossbar from a good position.

Foo-foo the First. \n\nMiles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge, keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and expecting to overtake them presently. He was disappointed in this, however. By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the way through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as to how to proceed. Still, he continued his efforts as best he could during the rest of the day. Nightfall found him leg-weary, half-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so he supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early start in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search. As he lay thinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: The boy would escape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go back to London and seek his former haunts? No, he would not do that, he would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do? Never having had a friend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would naturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not require him to go toward London and danger. He would strike for Hendon Hall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find him.

In Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u5b57; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u5b57). They have been adapted to write a number of other languages including: Japanese, where they are known as kanji, Korean, where they are known as hanja, and Vietnamese in a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m. Collectively, they are known as CJKV characters. In English, they are sometimes called Han characters. Chinese characters constitute the oldest continuously used system of writing in the world. By virtue of their widespread current use in East Asia, and historic use throughout the Sinosphere, Chinese characters are among the most widely adopted writing systems in the world. \n\nChinese characters number in the tens of thousands, though most of them are minor graphic variants encountered only in historical texts. Studies in China have shown that functional literacy in written Chinese requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters. In Japan, 2,136 are taught through secondary school (the J\u014dy\u014d kanji); hundreds more are in everyday use. There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations. Simplified forms of certain characters are used in China, Singapore, and Malaysia; the corresponding traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and to a limited extent in South Korea. In Japan, common characters are written in post-WWII Japan-specific simplified forms (shinjitai), which are closer to traditional forms than Chinese simplifications, while uncommon characters are written in Japanese traditional forms (ky\u016bjitai), which are virtually identical to Chinese traditional forms. In South Korea, when Chinese characters are used they are of the traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong. Teaching of Chinese characters in South Korea starts in the 7th grade and continues until the 12th grade where 1,800 total characters are taught albeit these characters are only used in certain cases (on signs, academic papers, historical writings, etc.) and are slowly declining in use.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What is used to write Asian languages?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What kind?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Do they use them in Japanese?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What do they call them?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What are they in standard Chinese?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "In Korean?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What do they use in Vietnam?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What are they referred to as in English?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How many Chinese characters are there?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How many should you know to be literate in Chinese?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How many forms are there?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where do they use traditional characters?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What kind do they use in Malaysia?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What about in Hong Kong?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many characters would you learn in a secondary school in Japan?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What is that group called?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Do they use more than that on a daily basis?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "When do they start learning them in South Korea?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "When do they stop?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "How many do they learn?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 422, "span_end": 432, "span_text": "characters", "input_text": "characters", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 417, "span_end": 432, "span_text": "CJKV characters", "input_text": "CJKV characters", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 260, "span_end": 300, "span_text": "Japanese, where they are known as kanji,", "input_text": "yes", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 294, "span_end": 299, "span_text": "kanji", "input_text": "kanji", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 99, "span_end": 137, "span_text": "Standard Chinese they are called Hanzi", "input_text": "Hanzi", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 332, "span_end": 338, "span_text": " hanja", "input_text": "hanja", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 357, "span_end": 383, "span_text": " a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m", "input_text": "a system known as ch\u1eef N\u00f4m", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 472, "span_end": 486, "span_text": "Han characters", "input_text": "Han characters", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 793, "span_end": 814, "span_text": "the tens of thousands", "input_text": "the tens of thousands", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 973, "span_end": 1039, "span_text": "requires a knowledge of between three and four thousand characters", "input_text": "between three and four thousand characters", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1146, "span_end": 1228, "span_text": "There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations", "input_text": "There are various national standard lists of characters, forms, and pronunciations", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1738, "span_end": 1752, "span_text": "In South Korea", "input_text": "In South Korea", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1230, "span_end": 1268, "span_text": "Simplified forms of certain characters", "input_text": "Simplified forms of certain characters", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1803, "span_end": 1899, "span_text": "traditional variant and are almost identical to those used in places like Taiwan and Hong Kong.

As he strives to be taken seriously and take charge of a city only recently back from the brink of bankruptcy, the baby-faced mayor said that even the smallest decisions felt weighty, even what to wear in the Steelers game matters. And another pressing issue is to strengthen the city's economy. Pittsburghhas lost all its mills, nearly half its population and much of its downtown commercial district in the last several decades. \"ButPittsburghhas 50,000 college students, and our challenge is to figure out how to retain them and to increase downtown development.\" He said. But one of the biggest uncertainties is how long he will remain in office. According to the city charter, Mayor Ravenstahl's term will not expire until November 2009. Some city lawyers, however, have argued that he must face the electorate next year. And residents in Pittsburghare still withholding judgment on him.

His anger and his new found confidence stimulated him to go at arithmetic problems with a new spirit. He now worked with interest, determination, and purpose, and he soon became extraordinarily good at arithmetic. He not only proved that he could do arithmetic, but he learned early in life from his own experience that, if a person goes at a job with determination and purpose, he may astonish himself as well as others by his ability. \n\nThis experience made him realize that many people have more ability than they think they have, and that lack of success is as often the result of lack of knowledge of how to

World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who did the study on global assets?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What did the study show?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Does their wealth continue to grow?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Do they expect to own half of the wealth by 2016?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Could that cause any economic problems?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Do you know what problems it could create?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Has the method been questioned?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "On what basis?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What is that?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Does a regions debt contribute to the the results?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What does Shorrocks say about the data?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Where are the most poor people located?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Anywhere else?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "Why?", "turn_id": 14}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 184, "span_text": "A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000.

MADONNA'S INGRATITUDE \n\nWe stayed in Fossombrone little more than a half-hour, and having made a hasty supper we resumed our way, giving out that we wished to reach Fano ere we slept. And so by the first hour of night Fossombrone was a league or so behind us, and we were advancing briskly towards the sea. Overhead a moon rode at the full in a clear sky, and its light was reflected by the snow, so that we were not discomforted by any darkness. We fell, presently, into a gentler pace, for, after all, there could be no advantage in reaching Pesaro before morning, and as we rode we talked, and I made bold to ask her the cause of her flight from Rome. \n\nShe told me then that she was Madonna Paola Sforza di Santafior, and that Pope Alexander, in his nepotism and his desire to make rich and powerful alliances for his family, had settled upon her as the wife for his nephew, Ignacio Borgia. He had been emboldened to this step by the fact that her only protector was her brother, Filippo di Santafior, whom they had sought to coerce.

Exaggerated ruffles, soft draping, frothy fabrics, dramatic trains and Cinderella-esque silhouettes gave new meaning to the term Hollywood royalty. \n\nThe few celebrities who bucked the romantic trend, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Sandra Bullock and Meryl Streep, chose sophisticated styles with retro vibes. \n\nFrom a timeless beauty (Demi Moore) to a graceful Hollywood icon (Meryl Streep), here are the night's fashion winners. \n\nDemi Moore \n\nDemi Moore often chooses classic, tailored cuts, but last night she glowed in a stunning blush-toned Atelier Versace silk organza gown with petal-like tiers of ruffles. She finished off this softer look with Van Cleef & Arpels tassel earrings and diamond cuffs, a gold leather Salvatore Ferragamo clutch and dress-matching Versace satin sandals. \n\nDiane Kruger \n\nThe ever-flawless Diane Kruger turned to her favorite designer Karl Lagerfeld for her cream and black chiffon gown from Chanel Haute Couture. Both edgy and feminine, the design featured a pleated and ruffled skirt that led into a bow-bedecked mermaid train. \n\nSee more dresses from the 2010 Academy Awards \n\nJennifer Lopez \n\nWe love the way Jennifer Lopez commands the red carpet in dramatic dresses, and her choice this year was no exception. Yet rather than going sexy (down-to-there Versace, anyone?), the diva went spectacular in a full-on princess-shaped icy pink Armani Prive confection with a Swarovski crystal-studded waterfall train.

In that year the old parliament building was burned down. Its clock tower fell to the ground. There had to be a new building and a new clock. Plans were made. They called for a \"King of Clock, the biggest and the best in the world\". So the clock had to be big. And it had to keep very good time. In two years the big clock was made. Five more years went by before the clock tower was last finished. Then the four bells for the chimes were brought into the tower. And at last the big hour bell was put in place. It rang out for the first time on July 11, 1859. This great bell had to have a name. A meeting of parliament was called to pick one. \"This clock is the king of clocks,\" one man said. \"Let's call the bell the Queen of Bells.\" \"Then why not Victoria?\" said another (Victoria was the British queen at that time). The talk about names went on and on. Then Benjamin Hall got up to speak. He was a big man. By this time they were all tired. Someone shouted, \"Why not call it Big Ben and be done with it?\" Everybody laughed, and the meeting was over. But it was called Big Ben from then on.

She sang like a lark as she swept and dusted; thought high and happy thoughts among the pots and kettles, and, when she sat sewing, smiled unconsciously as if some deep satisfaction made sunshine from within.

The \"Tao\" is a fundamental idea in most Chinese philosophical schools; in Taoism, however, it denotes the principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists. Taoism differs from Confucianism by not emphasizing rigid rituals and social order. Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize \"wu wei\" (effortless action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: \u6148 \"compassion\", \u5109 \"frugality\", and \u4e0d\u6562\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u5148 \"humility\". \n\nThe roots of Taoism go back at least to the 4th century BCE.

His assistant, Dr Watson, watches with admiration and then writes up the story of the mystery afterwards. This is a useful story writing skill. Because Watson is not very clever, the story remains a mystery until the end. The readers can sometimes pick up some clues before he does! Then, to make Watson understand the mystery, Holmes has to explain it all, step by step. So we, the readers, get to see it step by step too. Watson is almost as good a character in the story as Sherlock Holmes! The very first time they meet, Holmes greatly surprises Watson. When they are first introduced, Holmes says to Watson, 'How do you do? I see you have been to Afghanistan .' Watson is too amazed by this to ask Holmes how he knows this. Watson has, indeed, been to Afghanistan. Later, he asks Holmes about it. Holmes explains that there is nothing magical about what he does. He gets to know it all by very, very careful observation . Observation One Watson was introduced to Holmes as a doctor. Yet Holmes thought that the way he stood and walked made him seem like a soldier. So, this meant he was probably an army doctor. Observation Two Watson's face was quite dark skinned. But his wrists were pale. So his dark face was probably sun burnt. This meant that he had been to a hot, sunny country. Observation Three At the time, the British army had soldiers at bases in many parts of the world. So there were still a lot of places to choose from. However, Holmes saw that Watson looked very tired and he was always holding his left arm, as if it was painful. So, he had probably been with the army to a place where they were fighting.

All the wealth he has collected only serves to separate him from the rest of the world and it makes him defensive when around total strangers who cannot see him as a normal person. But now, he hears from his doctor that he has a terminal disease and has only months left to live.

Bringing a giraffe into the world is _ . In his book, A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, what the mother has done is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off again. Why? She wants it to remember how it can get up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying great people, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something unusual about these great people. He said, \"I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again. And at the end of their lives they've realized some small parts of what they set out to do.\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What position is giraffe in after being born?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What is its first lesson?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What does it have to do after being kicked?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What does the mother do after the baby stands up for the first time?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "What's the purpose of that?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Why is this so important?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Who used this survival technique in his works?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Which famous people did he write about?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What did he have to say about them?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Did having this happen to them make them want to give up on life?", "turn_id": 10}], "answers": [{"span_start": 53, "span_end": 65, "span_text": " on its back", "input_text": "on its back", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 435, "span_end": 450, "span_text": "kicks her baby,", "input_text": "Being kicked by it's mother.", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 496, "span_end": 503, "span_text": " get up", "input_text": "get up", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 693, "span_end": 735, "span_text": "Then the mother giraffe kicks it off again", "input_text": "Then the mother giraffe kicks it off again", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 742, "span_end": 785, "span_text": "She wants it to remember how it can get up.", "input_text": "She wants it to remember how it can get up.", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 786, "span_end": 882, "span_text": "In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group", "input_text": "In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 927, "span_end": 940, "span_text": "Irving Stone ", "input_text": "Irving Stone", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1034, "span_end": 1099, "span_text": "Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin", "input_text": "Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 1267, "span_end": 1341, "span_text": "They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere.", "input_text": "They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1343, "span_end": 1376, "span_text": "ut every time they stand up again", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 10}], "name": "middle3974.txt"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "33m4ia01qg1t26scv925i0tg4jhrx5", "filename": "NeolithicNeolithic_28f514e1284bade17d94a6449e96334e6b7856183cacd68d2a89bad9", "story": "Traditionally considered the last part of the Stone Age, the Neolithic followed the terminal Holocene Epipaleolithic period and commenced with the beginning of farming, which produced the \"Neolithic Revolution\".

Nor, since the half-crown must be disbursed on an escort for her, did the housewifely conscience object to the expedition, for Wilmet could not but long to thank the Superior and Sister Constance, and to obtain Dr. Lee's advice as to future management. Her coming was great joy to Cherry, who had dreaded the meeting almost with a sense of guilt, though still hoping Felix had been silent on her motive; and Wilmet did not betray him, but only treated her sister with a mixture of almost shy tenderness and reverence. Nor did Cherry dare to ask a question as to Wilmet's own affairs, nor even about Ferdinand Travis, lest she should seem to be leading in that direction. However, Wilmet, in a persuasive tone, communicated that Ferdinand had been long without writing, and though Cherry tried to be sorry for Alda, her spirit quailed at the state of temper her sister evidently meant to prepare her for. \n\nBut fate was more kind than she expected.

They made each other out as they were leaving their bags at the Fortinbras Arms, and arrived together in marked contrast--the tall, dark, regular-featured, soft- eyed Life-guardsman, and the little sandy, freckled, sun-dried engineer; and thus two courtships had to be carried on in the two rooms, only supplemented by the narrow parallelogram of a garden!

He is also an important prophet in Christianity, Islam, the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, and a number of other Abrahamic religions. \n\nAccording to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies.

But they were no match for it and the boat was out of control. \n\nTim knew it would soon be swallowed by the waves. \n\n\"Everything went quiet in my head,\" Tim recalls . \"I was trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.\" \n\nTim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. \"At one point, I considered turning back,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.\" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to yell to the boys, \"Take down the umbrella!\" \n\nChristian made much effort to take down the umbrella. Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat. He took over rowing, but the waves were almost too strong for him. \n\n\"Let's aim for the pier ,\" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. \"Can you guys swim?\" he cried. \"A little bit,\" the boys said. \n\nOnce they were in the water, Tim decided it would be safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs. Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys' faces. \n\n\"Are we almost there?\" they asked again and again. \"Yes,\" Tim told them each time. \n\nAfter 30minutes, they reached the pier.", "questions": [{"input_text": "When did this event take place?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Where did it take place?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who was the hero?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Who did he save?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How old were they?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "What were they doing?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What caused the issue?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "By what?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What was the danger the rescuer worried about?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "How long before he arrived to the helpless children?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "Did he come aboard?", "turn_id": 11}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 27, "span_text": "On a sunny day last August,", "input_text": "last August", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 0, "span_end": 154, "span_text": "On a sunny day last August, Tim heard some shouting.

It was not before famous British film director Hitchcock spotted her a decade later that her career took off. \n\nGreatly surprised by her expressive looks, the suspense master cast Fontaine in his first US film, a 1940 adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novel \"Rebecca\". She received an Academy Award nomination for her performance as a troubled wife. A year later, Fontaine finally won the long-sought golden figure, for her role as leading lady in \"Suspicion\" opposite Cary Grant, becoming the first and only actress to earn the title for a Hitchock film. \n\nAlthough her sister, Olivia de Havilland, preceded her in gaining Hollywood fame, Fontaine was the first of the sisters to win an Oscar, beating Olivia's nomination as best actress in Mitchell Leisen's \"Hold Back the Dawn\". \n\nThe dislike ,between the sisters was felt at the Oscars ceremony.\"I froze. I stared across the table, where Olivia was sitting.'Get up there!' she whispered commandingly,\" Fontaine said.\"All the dislike we'd felt toward each other as children...all came rushing back in quickly changing pictures...I felt Olivia would spring across the table and seize me by the hair.\" \n\nOlivia did not win her first Oscar until 1946, for her role as the lover of a World War I pilot in Leisen's \" To Each His Own\". Fontaine later made it known that her. sister had slighted her as she attempted to offer congratulations.\"She took one look at me, ignored my hand, seized her Oscar and wheeled away,\" she said. \n\nThe sisters were also reportedly competitors in love. Howard Hughes, a strange businessman who dated the elder de Havilland for a time, offered marriage to Fontaine several times.\"I married first, won the Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she'll undoubtedly be extremely angry because I beat her to it!\" Fontaine once joked. \n\nAs her film career fruited in the 1950s, Fontaine turned to television and dinner theatre, and also appeared in several Broadway productions, including the Lion in Winter\". Anything but the ordinary lady, Fontaine was also a licensed pilot, a champion balloonist, an accomplished golfer, a licensed .decoration designer and a first-class cook.", "questions":

The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!", "questions": [{"input_text": "Who has a pet?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What type?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "What colour is it?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "What is its name?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "How old is it?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How long have they owned it?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What does he get in trouble for?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Does the yelling stop him?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "What else?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Anything else?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "How do they punish him?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "What does he go after?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "What is bad about him?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What sort?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Is that it?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "Is bread part of his normal diet?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What does he get for dinner?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Why does he want bread?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Why would he like that so much?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Is he gentle with kids?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 28, "span_text": "The family across the street", "input_text": "The family across the street", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 33, "span_end": 38, "span_text": "a cat", "input_text": "Cat", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 46, "span_end": 64, "span_text": "a cute black kitty", "input_text": "Black", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 46, "span_end": 77, "span_text": "a cute black kitty named Dillon", "input_text": "Dillon", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 79, "span_end": 109, "span_text": "The cat is about two years old", "input_text": "Two", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 116, "span_end": 154, "span_text": "he family has had him for about a year", "input_text": "A year", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 1072, "span_end": 1115, "span_text": "They yell at him when he walks on the table", "input_text": "Walking on the table", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1117, "span_end": 1144, "span_text": "But Dillon does not listen.", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 704, "span_end": 793, "span_text": "Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away", "input_text": "Stealing sandwiches", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 880, "span_end": 957, "span_text": "The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns", "input_text": "Stealing buns", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 959, "span_end": 1045, "span_text": "The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water", "input_text": "Spraying him with water", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 285, "span_end": 344, "span_text": "Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders.", "input_text": "Insects", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 515, "span_end": 536, "span_text": "he likes to eat bread", "input_text": "He likes to eat bread", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 931, "span_end": 957, "span_text": "hot dog and hamburger buns", "input_text": "Hot dog and hamburger buns", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 703, "span_end": 794, "span_text": " Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away.", "input_text": "Sandwich", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 538, "span_end": 613, "span_text": "The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes", "input_text": "No", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 538, "span_end": 572, "span_text": "The family only feeds him cat food", "input_text": "Cat food", "turn_id": 17}, {"span_start": 615, "span_end": 703, "span_text": "But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can.", "input_text": "He likes the smell of bread", "turn_id": 18}, {"span_start": 1190, "span_end": 1374, "span_text": "The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!", "input_text": "His previous owner was a baker", "turn_id": 19}, {"span_start": 345, "span_end": 467, "span_text": "When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 20}], "name": "mc160.test.10"}, {"source": "wikipedia", "id": "3l2is5hsfaig646pxxa1p9p295nun6", "filename": "MammalMammal_434faf2e924139d4a67db9a08d76dc219e9aaf2a7e37554dbbf02e3b", "story": "Mammals include the largest animals on the planet, the rorquals and other large whales, as well as some of the most intelligent, such as elephants, primates, including humans, and cetaceans.

Syracuse, New York, to killing the college student, a prosecutor said. \n\nAlthough the 20-year-old victim's cell phone was never found, investigators were able to review call and text messages made by Watson and Steven Pieper, the man she was breaking up with, Onondaga County District William Fitzpatrick told CNN. \n\nAfter dumping Watson's body, Pieper, 21, tried to cover up by texting a mutual friend of theirs, pretending to be Watson, Fitzpatrick said. \n\nUsing the letters \"GTG\" apparently did him in. \n\nPolice looked at Pieper's phone, which was left November 19, 2010, at Watson's home in the Syracuse suburb of Liverpool, and pored over records, Fitzpatrick said. \n\nThat shorthand for \"got to go\" was a term used by Pieper, not Watson, the prosecutor said. \n\nPieper pleaded guilty in Onondaga County Court to second-degree murder in the strangling of Watson. Rather than 25 years to life, a plea agreement calls for him to receive a sentence of 23 years to life at the March 8 sentencing, Fitzpatrick said, adding Pieper must serve 23 years before he gets a parole hearing. \n\n\"Steven made it clear that he did not want to put the Watson family or his family through a trial in this matter, from the very beginning,\" defense attorney Scott Brenneck told CNN affiliate YNN. \"So after a review of the case, it was an appropriate way to resolve it.\" \n\nCNN left messages for Brenneck on Tuesday.

Under the leadership of Mohammed Omar, the movement spread throughout most of Afghanistan, sequestering power from the Mujahideen warlords.

It held control of most of the country until being overthrown by the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in December 2001 following the September 11 attacks. At its peak, formal diplomatic recognition of the Taliban's government was acknowledged by only three nations: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

American Dream \n\nThey may not have called it the American Dream, but for centuries people have gone to America in search of freer, happier, and richer lives. But is today's American Dream a mythical concept or still a reality? \n\nIsabel Belarsky's tiny Brooklyn apartment fills with the sound of her father's voice. Sidor Belarsky sings an Aria in Russian and 90-year-old Isabel, her lips painted an elegant red, sways gently to the song coming from her stereo. \n\nIsabel speaks with pride about her father's talent and his success as an opera singer: Albert Einstein was such a fan she says that he invited Sidor to accompany him on his speaking engagements and would ask him to sing to the audience. \n\nHow the Belarskys came to be in America is an extraordinary tale that Isabel loves to tell. It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad, that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia in 1930. \"Our dream was being in America,\" Isabel says. \"They loved it. My mother could never think of Russia, it was her enemy and my father, he made such a wonderful career here.\" \n\nLike generations of immigrants before them, the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom--to them the American Dream meant liberty. But Isabel says it promised even more. \"The dream is to work, to have a home and to get ahead. You can start as a janitor and become the owner of the building.\" \n\nThe American Dream is not written into the constitution but it is so ingrained in the national psyche that it might as well be. Many point to the second sentence in the Declaration of Independence--the \"certain unalienable rights\" that include \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" as the \"official\" version of the phrase. But it was actually in 1931 that the term was popularized, when historian James Truslow Adams wrote in The Epic of America that the Dream means \"a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank\". \n\nThe concept of the American Dream has not stayed static. For European immigrants, like Isabel, fleeing persecution in the first half of the last century, the Dream was about a life without persecution. \n\nBut somewhere in the middle of the last century the dream changed. As America's post war economy boomed, the new arrivals wanted more than freedom--they wanted a share of the prosperity as well. \n\nIn the 1950s, TV commercials featured housewives proudly showing off kitchens filled with gleaming appliances. The quest for liberation became a quest for Coca Cola. As the century wore on, the materialistic slant of the dream overtook the political side. Dallas and Dynasty suggested this was a country where it was possible to become not just rich, but filthily rich. \n\nCheyanne Smith was shocked at the deprivation that greeted her in America. She arrived in New York from the Caribbean seven years ago. Having watched endless American TV shows as a child, she thought she knew what to expect when her family moved to Brooklyn. Instead, the deprivation of one of New York's poorest neighbourhoods shocked her. \n\n\"I thought this is not America because this is not what I see on television,\" she says. Like Cheyanne, 18-year-old Franscisco Curiel is also ambitious. He came from Mexico City three years ago to go to college here but he's worried that Brooklyn's schools aren't going to give him a good enough education. \"The system is broken; we can't get the superior education that they supposedly want to give us,\" he says. \n\nThrough the centuries America's immigrants have endured terrible hardship and sacrifice so that they and their children can get ahead. Perhaps it's not surprising to hear the members of the Bushwick youth group lament the multiple, low paid jobs that their parents must do simply to get the rent paid and put food on the table. What is startling is that these bright, ambitious youngsters just don't believe that talent and hard work are enough to ensure they will ever have a shot at that mythical American Dream.", "questions": [{"input_text": "What kind of special skill did Isabel's father have?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "Who offered him a job?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Who saw him performing in Leningrad?", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "Did he ask him to work for him?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "For how long?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "Where was he from?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "What are they looking for in America?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "Where is Cheyanne Smith from?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "Where did she move to?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What part of New York?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Is that a rich neighborhood?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Was she surprised?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "What surprised her?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "Did she see a lot of deprivation?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "What did she expect America to be like?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "What did TV imply you could become in America?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "Are immigrants finding that to be accurate?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "Why are parents working low wage jobs?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Do the kids think they can achieve the American Dream?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 480, "span_end": 565, "span_text": "sabel speaks with pride about her father's talent and his success as an opera singer:", "input_text": "he was an opera singer", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 566, "span_end": 715, "span_text": "Albert Einstein was such a fan she says that he invited Sidor to accompany him on his speaking engagements and would ask him to sing to the audience.", "input_text": "Albert Einstein", "turn_id": 2, "bad_turn": "true"}, {"span_start": 849, "span_end": 917, "span_text": "a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad,", "input_text": "a Mormon college president", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 810, "span_end": 877, "span_text": "It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, ", "input_text": "Yes", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 809, "span_end": 846, "span_text": " It was the offer of a six-month job ", "input_text": "six months", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 809, "span_end": 1018, "span_text": " It was the offer of a six-month job by a Mormon college president, who had seen Sidor singing in Leningrad, that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia in 1930. \"Our dream was being in America,\"", "input_text": "in America", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 918, "span_end": 975, "span_text": "that enabled the Belarskys to escape from Stalin's Russia", "input_text": "Russia", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 1204, "span_end": 1254, "span_text": "the Belarskys came to America in search of freedom", "input_text": "freedom", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 2783, "span_end": 2918, "span_text": "Cheyanne Smith was shocked at the deprivation that greeted her in America.

This year, a worried-looking couple approached me. Their son, who had a sickly childhood, really wanted to play football. They'd tried to talk him out of it, but he had his heart set on joining the team. \n\nWhen they told me his name , my heart sank. Michael was short and thin. He was a lonely kid and the constant target of other kids' jokes. I knew Michael would never make it. But so close to my \"football is for everyone\" speech, I told them we could give it a try. \n\nOn the opening day of practice, Michael was the first player on the field. We started a one-mile jog around the track. Repeatedly he fell, each time picking himself up. The same thing happened for weeks. But Michael put his whole heart into the training. Cradually, Michael gained strength both socially and physically. He began to laugh and most of the teammates became friendly. By the last week of practice Michael could run the mile without falling. He asked me to add a few more exercises he could work on his own. Soon , Michael ran the opening mile faster than anyone. \n\nOne day after practice, the team captain, Steve, came up to me. He was talented but lazy.He was popular with students even though he could be heartless. Steve pointed to the field where Michael was jogging all alone and asked me why he was still out there. I told Steve to ask him. The next night, I was surprised to see Steve exercising right next to Michael. \n\nFinally our big game came-at first we were losing by twelve points.

Gradually, Saunders set up his mind on building up his body, increasing his speed and strength. At the age of 18, he ran his first marathon.

Greatly interested, Saunders read all he could about North Pole explorers and adventures; he decided that this would be his future. In 2001, after becoming a skillful skier, Saunders started his first long--distance expedition towards the North Pole. It took unbelievable energy. He suffered frostbite, ran into a polar bear and pushed his body to the limit, pulling his sled up and over the rocky mountains.

Her boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming: \"If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them!\"says the Greenbrier, prefix = st1 /Arkansas, mom. Tiger isn't the first dog to feel jealous of a baby. In the eyes of a pet's, there's a new star in town who's stealing his spotlight. Even the most gentle animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust -- and keep your baby safe. \n\nu Introduce Them with Care \n\nYour newborn and pet's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz, of Raleigh, North Carolina: \"Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell.\" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog will probably want to investigate right away. \n\nTo introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your newborn away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. \n\nu Learn the Safety Basics \n\nNo matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow, says Bonnie Beaver, DVM, past president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Number one: Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture (available in most pet stores).

He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, wrote in Koine Greek, and held Roman citizenship. The 14th-century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes gave his birthplace as the prominent Greek city Ptolemais Hermiou () in the Thebaid (). This attestation is quite late, however, and, according to Gerald Toomer, the translator of his \"Almagest\" into English, there is no reason to suppose he ever lived anywhere other than Alexandria. He died there around AD\u00a0168. \n\nPtolemy wrote several scientific treatises, three of which were of importance to later Byzantine, Islamic and European science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the \"Almagest\", although it was originally entitled the \"Mathematical Treatise\" (, \"Math\u0113matik\u0113 Syntaxis\") and then known as the \"Great Treatise\" (, \"H\u0113 Meg\u00e1l\u0113 Syntaxis\").

On one side was a wood of \"old-field pines\"--pines of recent growth and little value, that spring up on the old abandoned tobacco fields--and on the other a stretch of underbrush, with here and there a tree of tolerable size, but from which almost all the valuable timber had been cut. \n\nSelim was inclined to take things leisurely, and Harry gradually allowed him to slacken his pace into a walk, and even occasionally to stop and lower his head to take a bite from some particularly tempting bunch of grass by the side of the road.

The leather stayed smooth and the cowboy design unblemished . And when he looked inside, the contents brought back memories from 1946, when he apparently dropped the wallet behind the balcony bleachers in the Baker Middle School gym. \n\nFulton's Social Security Card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War Il ended. \n\nWorker Nathan Osborne found the wallet -- along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program -- while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17.

Stack Building, opened in 1936. \n\nFulton, 78, said he probably lost the wallet while cheering for the Baker High basketball team with a group of friends. Fulton said the bicycle ID was needed because he delivered medicine for Rodamar Drug. He was surprised, however, that his bicycle ID wasn't inside. He said he always kept it there. \n\nBut rather than focus on what was inside the wallet, Fulton said the recovery has led him to reflect on his life -- one that took him to the Korean War and Berlin before the return to Baker City. He worked at Ellingson Lumber Company for 30 years, from March 1964 to April 1994. \n\nSince his retirement, Fulton has enjoyed spending time with his 11-year-old black dog, Smokey.

He roamed irresolutely about for awhile, and at last wandered with careless steps towards the fire, which had been moved, from under the tree, close to the hut and a little to windward of its entrance. He squatted on his heels and began playing pensively with live embers, as was his habit when engrossed in thought, withdrawing his hand sharply and shaking it above his head when he burnt his fingers in a fit of deeper abstraction. Sitting there he could hear the murmur of the talk inside the hut, and he could distinguish the voices but not the words. Abdulla spoke in deep tones, and now and then this flowing monotone was interrupted by a querulous exclamation, a weak moan or a plaintive quaver of the old man. Yes. It was annoying not to be able to make out what they were saying, thought Babalatchi, as he sat gazing fixedly at the unsteady glow of the fire. But it will be right. All will be right. Abdulla inspired him with confidence. He came up fully to his expectation. From the very first moment when he set his eye on him he felt sure that this man--whom he had known by reputation only--was very resolute. Perhaps too resolute. Perhaps he would want to grasp too much later on. A shadow flitted over Babalatchi's face.

In principle, the choice of standard state is arbitrary, although the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends a conventional set of standard states for general use. IUPAC recommends using a standard pressure \"p\"\u00a0= 10\u00a0Pa. Strictly speaking, temperature is not part of the definition of a standard state. For example, as discussed below, the standard state of a gas is conventionally chosen to be unit pressure (usually in bar) ideal gas, regardless of the temperature. However, most tables of thermodynamic quantities are compiled at specific temperatures, most commonly or, somewhat less commonly, . \n\nThe standard state should not be confused with standard temperature and pressure (STP) for gases, nor with the standard solutions used in analytical chemistry. \n\nFor a given material or substance, the standard state is the reference state for the material's thermodynamic state properties such as enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and for many other material standards.

Then the school's hard-driving headmaster, Delores Bolton, persuaded her board to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use, in school and at home. What's more, the board provided wireless Internet access at school. Total cost: $2.5 million. Now, an hour before classes start, every seat in the library is taken by students who cannot wait for getting online. Fifth-grade teacher Jen Friday talks about different kinds of birds as students view them at a colorful website. After school, students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework. Since the computer arrived, enrollment is up 20%. Scores on state tests are up 35%. Indeed, school systems in rural Maine and New York City also hope to follow Arace Middle School's example. Governor Angus King had planned using $50 million to buy a laptop for all of Maine's 17,000 seventh-graders - and for new seventh-graders each fall. In the same spirit, the New York City board of education voted on April 12 to create a school Internet portal , which would make money by selling ads and licensing public school students. Profits will also provide e-mail service for the city's 1.1 million public school students. Profits will be used to buy laptops for each of the school system's 87,000 fourth-graders. Within nine years, all students in grades 4 and higher will have their own computers. Back in Bloomfield, in the meantime, most of the _ have been worked out. Some students were using their computers to visit unauthorized websites. But teachers have the ability to keep an eye on where students have been on the Web and to stop them. \"That is the worst when they disable you,\" says eighth-grade honors student Jamie Bassell. The habit is rubbing off on parents. \"I taught my mom to use e-mail,\" says another eighth-grader, Katherine Hypolite. \"And now she's taking computer classes.

Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97. \n\n\"We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,\" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. \"But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must.\" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital. \n\nWith wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power. \n\nNow turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption. \n\nThough considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares. \n\nEach share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. \"There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,\" says Vad Mathiesen. \n\nGoing green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly. \n\nCertainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, \"With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills.\" \n\n\"We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,\" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. \"Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature. I hope we'll have them all over the world,\" she says. \"They may be unpleasant to some, but better-looking ones will come. It's just that we don't have time to wait for them!\"", "questions": [{"input_text": "What are countries debating?", "turn_id": 1}, {"input_text": "What country is building wind turbines?", "turn_id": 2}, {"input_text": "Where are they doing it.", "turn_id": 3}, {"input_text": "How many were built recently?", "turn_id": 4}, {"input_text": "Where?", "turn_id": 5}, {"input_text": "How much of the country's energy does it account for?", "turn_id": 6}, {"input_text": "What is one of the first things you will see if you fly there?", "turn_id": 7}, {"input_text": "Are the ones in urban places more expensive than ones in the water?", "turn_id": 8}, {"input_text": "How much cheaper are they?", "turn_id": 9}, {"input_text": "What is becoming more popular these days?", "turn_id": 10}, {"input_text": "What do they represent?", "turn_id": 11}, {"input_text": "Who said that?", "turn_id": 12}, {"input_text": "Does she reside there?", "turn_id": 13}, {"input_text": "How much electric does an average house there use?", "turn_id": 14}, {"input_text": "How many people have purchased shares?", "turn_id": 15}, {"input_text": "How many in all were purchased?", "turn_id": 16}, {"input_text": "Is it embraced by the people?", "turn_id": 17}, {"input_text": "What do they say we have destroyed?", "turn_id": 18}, {"input_text": "To do what?", "turn_id": 19}, {"input_text": "Who said that?", "turn_id": 20}], "answers": [{"span_start": 0, "span_end": 86, "span_text": "While other countries debate whether to fix wind turbines offshore or in distant areas", "input_text": "Whether to fix wind turbines offshore or in distant areas.", "turn_id": 1}, {"span_start": 86, "span_end": 134, "span_text": ", Denmark is building them right in its capital.", "input_text": "Denmark", "turn_id": 2}, {"span_start": 87, "span_end": 134, "span_text": " Denmark is building them right in its capital.", "input_text": "The capital.", "turn_id": 3}, {"span_start": 135, "span_end": 175, "span_text": "Three windmills were recently introduced", "input_text": "Three", "turn_id": 4}, {"span_start": 134, "span_end": 205, "span_text": " Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood", "input_text": "Copenhagen", "turn_id": 5}, {"span_start": 531, "span_end": 587, "span_text": "With wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply", "input_text": "33%", "turn_id": 6}, {"span_start": 651, "span_end": 787, "span_text": "among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers", "input_text": "chain of sea-based wind towers", "turn_id": 7}, {"span_start": 870, "span_end": 977, "span_text": "Now turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based.", "input_text": "No.", "turn_id": 8}, {"span_start": 870, "span_end": 976, "span_text": "Now turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based", "input_text": "They are less than half the price.", "turn_id": 9}, {"span_start": 1257, "span_end": 1313, "span_text": " the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century", "input_text": "the windmill", "turn_id": 10}, {"span_start": 1331, "span_end": 1371, "span_text": " symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,", "input_text": "A symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen.", "turn_id": 11}, {"span_start": 1314, "span_end": 1402, "span_text": " \"Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,\" says resident Susanne Sayers.", "input_text": "Susanne Sayers.", "turn_id": 12}, {"span_start": 1373, "span_end": 1402, "span_text": "says resident Susanne Sayers.", "input_text": "Yes.", "turn_id": 13}, {"span_start": 1778, "span_end": 1843, "span_text": "With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year", "input_text": "3,500 kW hours a year", "turn_id": 14}, {"span_start": 1923, "span_end": 1971, "span_text": "To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares.", "input_text": "500", "turn_id": 15}, {"span_start": 1923, "span_end": 1970, "span_text": "To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares", "input_text": "2,500", "turn_id": 16}, {"span_start": 2343, "span_end": 2375, "span_text": "Accepted by the population?

She was 80. \n\nShe is survived by her husband, their two sons, John and David, and six grandchildren, the Ravens said. \n\nModell, also known as Patricia Breslin, appeared on television, film, and the New York stage during her 22-year acting career, the Ravens said. Her most widely known role was as nurse Meg Bentley in the daytime soap opera General Hospital in the late 1960s, and she also played Laura Brooks on the primetime TV drama \"Peyton Place.\" \n\nModell was also a regular on \"Twilight Zone,\" \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\" \"Perry Mason,\" and \"Maverick.\" \n\nAt one point, the Ravens said, Modell had appeared in more television shows than any other woman in U.S. history. Her record was eventually broken by one of her closest friends, the late Lucille Ball. \n\nModell retired from acting after the couple married in 1969 and became involved in philanthropy. In Cleveland, she did work for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Cerebral Palsy Association, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. \n\nShe and her husband started and funded the Hospice of the Western Reserve in Cleveland. \n\nModell was a major contributor in Baltimore to the St. Vincent's Center and the Baltimore Museum of Art. The Modells contributed $3.5 million to the Lyric Opera House, which was recently renamed the Patricia and Arthur Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric. \n\nThe Modells pledged $5 million to help start a public boarding school, The SEED School, for disadvantaged students. They were named the 2009 Outstanding Philanthropists of the Year for their work and donations by the Association of Fundraising Professionals in Maryland.
